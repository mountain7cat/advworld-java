@Derrick. We are not using those, it limits the number of exit we can have from one location
	Room description is dynamic for now as we have more and more things in. ideally,
	Location.decription() should print only what's necessary about the Location. Each childclass
	of Location will have their own description() method which calls its super.
	
	I'll update the function names to be more descriptive i.e. "Loc1_to_Loc2_Locked".
	It was autogenerated by Eclipse.

@Sam are we using North, s, e, w, up, down? how do you want to parse room descriptions?
   You can change the LOCK parser to include two fields so can lock rooms from both sides. 
   also you might want to switch your conventions to go from room to room. right now you have
   it true = can go vs. true = lock.
