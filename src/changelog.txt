Change Log:

Change implementation for connection - AGAIN. Back to one way channel, renamed
to path. Decision was that memory saved wasn't worth the messy implmentation.

Added keyword to World Description EXIT to differentiate between CONNECTIONS and
one way path.

Refactored setupXXXX methods to allow future usage.

Added some new location classes. Made a "world" in the testworld.txt. formats could be wrong (?).
Initializes to testworld.txt. Right now it does not initialize... advworld.util.utility.setupworld needs to be looked at.
