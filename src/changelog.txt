7/24/09 3:13AM - Sam (v 1.0.6.1)
Completed world parsing functionality for EXIT, CONNECTION, and LOCATION.
textworld.txt was wrong because it was malformed. Fixed that, too.

Change implementation for connection - AGAIN. Back to one way channel, renamed
to path. Decision was that memory saved wasn't worth the messy implmentation.

Added keyword to World Description EXIT to differentiate between CONNECTIONS and
one way path.

Refactored setupXXXX methods to allow future usage.

7/23/09 - 4:46 pm - Derrick (v 1.0.5.1)
Added some new location classes. Made a "world" in the testworld.txt. formats could be wrong (?).
